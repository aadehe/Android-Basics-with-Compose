### A personal journey into Android development with Jetpack Compose

Welcome to my **Android Basics with Compose** repository!
This project documents my journey through Google’s official beginner course on Android development using Jetpack Compose — the modern toolkit for building beautiful and responsive Android UIs with Kotlin.
Each app in this repository was built from scratch as part of the learning path. Together, they showcase my progress in mastering Android fundamentals — from designing simple interfaces to building apps with architecture, data persistence, and network connectivity.

## About This Project
This repository is part of my Android Developer Portfolio, created to demonstrate my skills and understanding of core Android concepts while following best practices recommended by Google.
Through these projects, I explore:
* Building UIs with Jetpack Compose
* Applying Material Design 3 principles
* Managing state and navigation
* Using Room for data storage
* Fetching data from APIs with Retrofit
* Writing clean, testable code using ViewModel and other architecture components
